  IBM AIX XL FORTRAN Compiler/6000

  Usage:
     xlf  [ option | file ] ...

  Description:
     The xlf command compiles XL FORTRAN source files.  It also processes
     assembler source files and object files. Unless the -c option is
     specified, xlf calls the linkage editor to produce a single object
     file. Input files can be any of the following:
       1. file name with .f suffix: FORTRAN source file
       2. file name with .o suffix: object file for ld command
       3. file name with .s suffix: assembler source file.

  Options:
     Options can be one or more of the following:

       1. flag options:

        -#        Display verbose information on the compiler's progress
                  without invoking anything.
        -1        Execute DO loops at least once, if reached.
        -B<prefix>
                  Construct alternate preprocessor/compiler/assembler/
                  linkage editor program names.  <prefix> is added to the
                  beginning of the standard program names.
        -c        Compile only; do not call the linkage editor.
        -C        Perform run-time checking of array bounds and character
                  substring expressions.
        -D        Compile lines of FORTRAN code that have a D in column 1.
        -F<x>[:<stanza>]
                  Use alternate configuration file <x> with optional stanza,
                  <stanza>.  If <stanza> is not specified, xlf is assumed.
        -g        Produce debug information.
        -I<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for INCLUDE files that
                  do not start with an absolute path.
        -k        State that FORTRAN code is in free-form input format.
        -l<key>   Search the specified library file,
                  where <key> selects the file lib<key>.a.
        -L<dir>   Search in directory <dir> for files specified by -l<key>.
        -N        Display help information for -N<x><num> option.
        -N<x><num>
                  Specify internal table sizes
                  where <x> can be B, C, D, N, P, A, Q, T, or S
                  and <num> is used to calculate the table size.
        -o<name>  Name the executable file <name> instead of a.out.
        -O        Optimize code generated by the compiler.
        -p        Generate simple profiling support code.
        -pg       Generate profiling support code.  Provides more extensive
                  profiling than -p.
        -P        Invoke the preprocessor before the compiler
        -P!       Invoke the preprocessor only
        -Q        Inline all appropriate subprograms.
        -Q<x>     Inline specified subprograms
                  where <x> can be one of the following:
                    !        = do not inline
                    -<names> = do not inline the list of subprograms, <names>
                    +<names> = inline the list of subprograms, <names>.
        -t<x>     Apply prefix from the -B option to the specified program <x>,
                  where <x> can be one or more of the following:
                    c = compiler
                    a = assembler
                    l = linkage editor
                    p = preprocessor
        -u        Specify undefined (no) implicit data typing.
        -U        Suppress lowercase folding of FORTRAN code.
        -v        Display verbose information on the compiler's progress.
        -w        Suppress informational, language-level, and warning messages.
        -W<x>,<option1>[,<option2>[, ... [,<optionN>] ... ]]
                  Send options to program <x>,
                  where <x> is defined as for -t<x> option.
        -y<x>     Specify compile-time rounding of constant floating-point
                  expressions, where <x> can be one of the following:
                    n = round to nearest
                    m = round toward minus infinity
                    p = round toward positive infinity
                    z = round toward zero.

       2. other options:

          Other options are specified as follows:

          -q<option>

            where <option> is an on/off switch such that, if x is the
            option, -qx turns the option on, and -qnox turns the
            option off.  For example, -qsource tells the compiler
            to produce a source listing, and -qnosource tells the compiler
            not to produce a source listing.

            The following override the initial compiler settings:

            attr        Produce attribute listing (only referenced names).
            dbcs        Indicate that character or Hollerith constants
                        can contain DBCS characters.
            ddim        Indicate that dimension declarators for pointees
                        can contain variable names for dynamic dimensioning.
            dpc         Promote basic floating-point constants
                        to double precision.
            extchk      Perform procedure interface checking as well as
                        detection of mismatched common blocks.
            extname     Suffix an underscore to all external names
                        (except for main program names).
            fips        Perform full ANSI FORTRAN 77 flagging.
            hsflt       Never round single-precision expressions,
                        and don't perform range checking for floating-point
                        to integer conversions.
            hssngl      Round single-precision expressions only when the results
                        are stored into REAL*4 memory locations.
            list        Produce object listing.

            recur       Allow recursive subprograms.
            rndsngl     Ensure strict adherence to IEEE standard.  That is,
                        all operations on single-precision values produce
                        results that remain in single precision.
            rrm         Specify run-time rounding mode.  Compile with this
                        option if the run-time rounding mode is round toward
                        minus infinity, round toward positive infinity,

                        be reported in listing.
            xref        Produce cross-reference listing (only referenced names).

          -q<option>=<suboption>
          -q<option>=<suboption1>:<suboption2>:...:<suboptionN>

            where <option> is assigned a specific suboption value or list
            of suboption values as follows:

            attr=full   Produce attribute listing
                        (all names, whether referenced or not).
            autodbl=dblpad

                        to double and extended precision, respectively.
            charlen=<num>

            halt=<sev>  Stop compiler after first phase if severity of errors
                        detected equals or exceeds <sev>.
            xref=full   Produce cross-reference listing
                        (all names, whether referenced or not).
