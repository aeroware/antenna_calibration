	DIGLIB for UNIX -- Hal Brand 5-Apr-1990
	Derived from Steve Azevedo's README file.

This is the UNIX version of DIGLIB 3.4!

It has been tested on a VS2000 running ULTRIX 3.1/UWS 2.1 and on a Sun 3
(version 4.0 of SunOS with MIT X11R3).

1) Naming conventions:
	a) The diglib library is the file "diglib.a"
	b) DIGLIB FORTRAN sources are *.f
	c) DIGLIB C sources are *.c
	d) DIGLIB include files are now in lowercase letters.
	e) Aside from "demo.f" and "demo-x11.f", DIGLIB test program sources
		are *.prg
	f) DIGLIB routines not converted to UNIX are *.vms
		(this is mainly the VMS drivers.)
	g) DIGLIB/UNIX font files are named *.fon. They are made from the .fnt
		files via the makefont command. Currently, this must be done
		manually!
	h) VMS's CONVERT.FOR is called "makefont.f"
	i) All other files are the same as their counterpart in VMS.

2) Incompatabilities:
	a) The X11 driver (gdx11.c) will not work with previous versions
		of DIGLIB, i.e. versions prior to V3.4! This is due to
		modifications primarily to devsel.f and the addition of
		gsgdev.f to support the X11 driver.

3) DIGLIB/UNIX now has a full blown "Makefile"!	To build DIGLIB/UNIX:
	a) edit "gsdrvr.f" as necessary.
	b) rm diglib.a (if there is one)
	c) edit "Makefile" to suit your configuration and driver selections
		made in "gsdrvr.f"
	d) Issue the "make" command and take a break!
	e) X11 users will want to also do a "make demo-x11"
	f) Test with "demo" and if using X11, with "demo-x11"
	g) Users wanting the additional fonts should use makefont to manually
		make each desired from. Remember to setup the DIGLIB
		environment variable also!

4) UNIX DIGLIB drivers that are currently supported are:
	gdrtro	-- DEC VT100 with Retrographics
	gdsun1	-- Sun 2/100 and 2/150 (1024 x 800) using SunView.
			RUN FROM GFXTOOL!
	gdsun2	-- Sun 2 and 3 machines (1152 x 900; color or mono).
			(the 3/110 works with the gdsun2 driver)
			RUN FROM GFXTOOL!
	gdsuncg1 -- Sun medium res color (640 x 480); must have /dev/cgone0.
			RUN FROM GFXTOOL!
	gdpst	-- Tall postscript laser printer driver.
	gdpsw	-- Wide postscript laser printer driver.
			(both of the last two are in gdpostscr.f)
	gdx0	-- X10 color or monochrome driver.
	gdx11   -- X11 color or monochrome driver.

	It should not be hard to add other drivers given these.

5) The fonts are the same as those in VMS.  The way to get the fonts
	is to have an environment variable called DIGLIB set up with the
	directory of the diglib fonts.  All users must have this variable
	(it can be put into the .login or .profile file).  Use a line like:

			setenv DIGLIB /usr/u0/sam/diglib/

	(don't leave out the trailing slash or it won't work.)  Now all
	calls to GSFONT will work as advertised.

6) For Sun users:  A graphics tool called newgfxtool.prg (and built with
	"loadc newgfxtool") is in this directory.  It contains an argument
	to make the text portion of the window larger than the default for
	gfxtool.  To use it, try "newgfxtool -T400" (note that Sun defaults
	it to 200 pixels).  It is otherwise identical to the Sun version
	of gfxtool.
