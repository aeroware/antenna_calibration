DIGLIB VERSION 3.4
	NOTE - The VAX/VMS FORTRAN compiler (V4.x) has an overzealous optimizer.
		If you note problems with DIGLIB, suspect the compiler and try
		compiling the routines with /NOOPT.   It is already known that
		the V4.1 compiler doesn't handle LINLAB properly.
		The problem appears fixed in V4.2 of the compiler.
		There are no know problems with DIGLIB and VMS FORTRAN V4.3.
  History:
	3.0A - fixed SYAXIS to properly call AXIS.
	3.0B - fixed polygon fill color in VMS 4105 driver.
	3.0C - fixed typo in RT 4105 driver.
	3.0D - VMS GDIO.FOR improved, HPGL plotter support for VMS added.
	3.0E - Fixed IFLAGS ignored bug in HATCH and fixed bug in GSWDTH.
	3.1  - VMS version now has loadable fonts via GSFONT.   The functions
		GSWDTH and GSSLEN have been eliminated.
	3.1A - Enhanced VMS Tek. 4025 driver to use TEK_4025CC and TEK_4025COM
		logical names for more run-time control.   Also, driver now
		switches the 4025 out of ANSI mode on device select.
	3.1B - Added Tek. 4115B driver for VMS.
	3.1C - Fixed bug in VMS Font code.   Width of a space is now
		consistant.
	3.1D - Enhanced VMS GD4010CON module to transmit only the absolutely
		necessary characters for (X,Y) coordinate pairs.  Documentation
		upgraded.
	3.1E - Fixed bug in GSFILL.   Created problems when virtual coordinates
		were not also absolute coordinates.
	3.1F - Fixed problem where MAPIT called sucessively without intervening
		calls to MAPPRM (etc.) and with 2nd X axis, caused plot Y axis
		to shrink each time.
	3.1G - VT125 and VT240 drivers added as unsupported drivers, and
		distribution to floppy for VMS changed.
	3.1H - GDIO modified to accept a BEGIN_STRING in VMS version to better
		support devices like the HP plotters.
	3.1I - Documentation updated.
	3.2  - Fixed bug in MAPPRM, MAPSIZ, MAPSZ2, GSWNDO, and DEVSEL so that
		high level XY plotting works properly after GSWNDO is called.
		Also fixed bug in CONTOR that added horizontal and vertical
		lines in rare instances.   Also fixed bug in GDIO.
		Documentation updated to remove reference to PLTLIB manual.
		Fixed numerous drivers to function properly with GDIO2BUF.
		Drivers now must call GB_SEND_CHARS, not GD_SEND_TTY!
	3.2A - Added a 400 millisec. delay to VMS Retro-Graphics driver to
		avoid hanging the terminal under certain circumstances.
	3.2B - Added "change font blips" so that fonts can be selected within
		a character string.
	3.2C - Fixed bug in VAX/VMS Tek 4115B driver where filling in foreground
		color didn't work unless GSCOLR was called first.
	3.2D - Modified "change font blips" to be of the form "\n\" so that
		they could be input as text.
	3.2E - Fixed minor bug in MAPIT ans SYAXIS concerning horizontal
		placement of Y axis label.
	3.2F - Fixed MAPIT to use solid lines while preserving caller's line
		type.
	3.2G - DIGLIB.H added for C programmers thanks to Carol Chapman.
		VMS Postscript driver enhanced for unique file names.
	3.2H - Fixed "missing INCLUDE statement" problem in GDIO and GDIO2BUF
		that rendered the GDHPPL driver non-functional.
	3.2I - Fixed AXIS so that axis endpoints, stripped of their power of
		ten, are always less than 100 in absolute value.   This fixes
		a problem in LINLAB that would have been too hard to fix there.
		The problem only occured on 16 bit machines.
	3.2J - Fixed SYMBOL always to draw symbols in solid lines, and to be
		able to draw filled-in symbols.   Modified CURVE and CURVEY to
		support the new capabilities of SYMBOL.
	3.2K - Fixed clipping when applied to MAPIT axes so that clipping box
		extends to the end of the tick marks.
	3.3  - "Official" NESC release of DIGLIB on 4/23/86. PURJOY upgraded.
	3.3A - Tek 4105 and 4107 drivers upgraded.
	3.3B - Some new drivers added, GDLASER upgraded, and GDIO modified
		so that it can be LIBR/REPLACEd by GDIO2BUF without problems.
	3.3C - Fixed nasty bug in SGLUE in STRINGLIB for VMS that caused
		caller's R2 and R3 to be destroyed.
	3.3D - GSFILL now uses NFLINE when filling as it always should have.
		Also, HATCH will now solid fill if CMSPAC=0.0
	3.3E - Unsupported subroutines VIEW3D.FOR and SCAL3D.FOR, plus test
		program T3D.FOR for 3D to 2D projection now included in
		DIGLIB. Note, these routines are neither compiled, added to
		the DIGLIB.OLB library, nor documented. However, the files
		contain "sufficient" documentation.
	3.3F - Fixed Tek 4115B, 4105, AND 4107 drivers for VMS for proper GIN 
		operation and filled polygons WITH borders.
	3.4 - Modifications to Support X11 driver.
