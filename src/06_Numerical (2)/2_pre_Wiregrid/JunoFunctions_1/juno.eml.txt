We propose to generate a table for case 1) and another for case 2), each table comprising "subtended angle" in delta-steps between 90 and 120 deg, 
versus "rotated angle" in delta-steps between 30 and 45 deg. We understand that the optimum configuration could be read out of both tables 
when the h_effs are orthogonal to each other.
