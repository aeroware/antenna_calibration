Tabulated values of the length of the effective length
vectors and the angle between the two effective length
vectors as a function of the configuration, the angle between
the physical antennas and the angle between the z-axis and
the plane of the antennas.

Configuration 1 means that the antennas are located below a
solar panel, while at configuration 2 the antennas are located
between two solar panels.

I want to emphasize that the angle between the antennas is not
the azimutal abgle, but the real subtended angle between the
antennas or effective length vectors.
