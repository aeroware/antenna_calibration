Version 1.1.1

21 January 2005.

* Cleaned up and reworked patch subdivision.
* Fixed a bug in interpolate() caused by not having the precalculated data static. Thanks to Neokolis for pointing this out.
* Cleaned up rom2() and rechecked program flow.


Version 1.1.0

20 January 2005.

* Got LAPACK going. There is generally a 100% speedup. However the LAPACK routines sometimes
produce different answers to the built in LU decomposition routine? Therefore LAPACK LU decompositions is still not included in the default build.
* Fixed up a re-initialization problem in the temporary geometry files.
* Several Improved testharness code.
* Moved temporary geometry into the geometry class. Set this up in the geometry_complete() method.
* Added #include <unistd.h> to misc.cpp
* Ignore Radiation Pattern Polarization angles in the testharness where the power level is -999 dB. These have no physical meaning and are often different with LAPACK.

Version 1.0.8

December 2004.

* Clean up of nec_context member variables s,b. Renamed m_s, and m_b
* Added member function to c_geometry for testing whenther we should be using a thin wire approximation or not.
* Fix problem introduced in the Sommerfeld-Norton ground condition, added more testharness stuff.

Version 1.0.7

December 2004.

* Switched command-line option parsing to XGetopt for cross platform compatibility
* Fixed major bug in Win32 executable that caused a crash on file output. Added Visual Studio Project files
* Changed member 'near' of nec_context to m_near to avoid a conflict with the VC++ reserved word 'near'
* Modified the error message macro to allow compilation on Visual C++. This causes error messages to NOT have a content
if nec2++ is compiled with a non-C99 standard compiler.

Version 1.0.6

December 2004.

* Fix for non-initialization of voltage sources if no excitations were specified (Thanks to Jerome Plet)
* Cleaned up code for bad loop in nec_context (Thanks to Neoklis Kyriazis for this)
* Removed old Numerical Greens Functions code and variables -- these were not doing anything (ib11 e.t.c.)
* All system exit (stop()) calls have been removed and replaced by exceptions (apart from those inside the main command line programme)


Version 1.0.5

December 2004.

* Fix for not clearing temporary geometry correctly.
* Moved more stop(-1) commands to throwing nec_exceptions.
* Improved Doxygen Comments
* Added arc and helix commands to the nec_context object.


Version 1.0.4

November 2004.

This version includes significant changes. nec2++ can now be called from a C API, although I am still figuring out how to remove the requirement for linking to the standard C++ library! Help would be appreciated here. See the examples directory in the source tree.

This version has also moved to KDevelop and autoconf as the primary development environment. This means that nec2++ can be build using the industry standard './configure', 'make' and 'make install' commands.

Please note that my aim is to NOT require KDevelop to build this project, but rather I am using it here. I might well have missed something when creating the source distribution. If I have, please let me know.
